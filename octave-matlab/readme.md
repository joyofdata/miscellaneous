# Functions from Matlab missing in Octave

The functions provided here should be compatible to the Matlab counterparts so they can be used plug and play.

I am using Ubuntu 13.10 64bit and Octave 3.8 - so the functions here are tested on that setup.

The initial motivation for this project is the edX course "[Discrete Time Signals and Systems](https://www.edx.org/course/ricex/ricex-elec301x-discrete-time-signals-1032)" by Prof. Baraniuk from Rice University.
